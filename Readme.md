# Google Instant
## Overview
Google launched `Google Instant` in 2010, and then withdrew it in 2017 because of device compatibility issues.
This Chrome extension miraculously brings back `Google Instant`,which means after installing it ,you will be able to see your results on Google while typing the query.

## Download
The extension is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-instant/pgkcggibpkmllknengmmihdoeaifkmmc).
