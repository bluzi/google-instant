# Google Instant
## Overview
Google launched `Google Instant` in 2010, and then withdrew it in 2017 because of device compatibility issues.
This Chrome extension miraculously brings back `Google Instant`, which means after installing it, you will be able to see your results on Google while typing the query.

## Download
The extension is available at: here
